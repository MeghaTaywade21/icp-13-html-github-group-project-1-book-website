      dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives,
      mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked

      Biryani (/bɜːrˈjɑːni/) is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims
      of the Indian subcontinent. It is made with Indian spices, rice, and
      usually some type of meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, fish) or in
      some cases without any meat, and sometimes, in addition, eggs and
      potatoes.
